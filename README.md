# Instabilities in Heliospheric Magnetic Flux Ropes
Repository for my Bachelor's Thesis, developed at the Heliophysics Science Division of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, under the supervision of Teresa Nieves-Chinchilla.

My thesis can be found in "thesis.pdf".
The results supporting my thesis can be found in "main_notebook", as Python scripts in a Jupyter Notebook.
The functions necessary to evaluate the dispersion relation have been adapted from scripts by Marta Florido Llin√†s, which have helped me a lot.
The other files are auxiliary.
