# Instabilities in Heliospheric Magnetic Flux Ropes
Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor's Thesis, developed at the Heliophysics Science Division of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, under the supervision of Dr. Teresa Nieves-Chinchilla.

The thesis full text can be downloaded from "thesis.pdf".
The programs supporting the plots in the thesis can be found in "main_notebook", in the form of Python scripts in a Jupyter Notebook.
The functions necessary to evaluate the dispersion relation have been adapted from scripts by Marta Florido Llin√†s, which have helped me a lot.
The other files are auxiliary.
